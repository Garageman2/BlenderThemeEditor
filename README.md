# BlenderThemeEditor
A Quick Javscript theme Editor for Blender

This is a javascript program that takes in a blender XML theme, identifies every unique color, and draws a rectangle in that color which can be clicked on
to access a color selector. This will replace the color everywhere it occurs in the source theme in the output theme it generates which can be put back into Blender.
